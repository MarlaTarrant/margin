                                                China has become a major actor in the global economy as well as the most
                                                prominent emerging power in Africa; however, its relationships with
                                                African states have been met with an equal share of both praise and
                                                animosity. An emerging power can be defined as a state that has become
                                                more involved in global affairs, and more specifically, global economic
                                                and political affairs, than it was in the past. Through a development of
                                                political but primarily economic relations with a number of African
                                                states, China as an emerging power in Africa, has played a much larger
                                                role than other emerging powers through its efforts towards
                                                infrastructural development, trade, policies and investments.

                                            <blockquote>
                                                China has consolidated its role in Africa as a trading partner, advisor
                                                and source of capital investment towards the promotion of
                                                infrastructural development, peace and security in Africa. It has also
                                                been criticised for exploiting African states through both political and
                                                economic means, providing arms and military support to authoritarian
                                                regimes, and misusing gained leverage in order to monopolize trade in
                                                African natural resources.

                                                This assignment is an analysis of China’s role as an emerging power in
                                                Africa, in the global economy and its impact on African development.
                                                This analysis will be accomplished by assessing the current and
                                                predicted effects of China and Africa’s political and economic relations
                                                by specifically looking at several African states, namely Mozambique,
                                                the Sudan and Zimbabwe and how China influences and affects these
                                                relationships by focusing on current issues facing bilateral relations
                                                with each of these states, developmental efforts undertaken by China as
                                                well as environmental degradation and social inequality caused, directly
                                                and indirectly, by China in these states.

                                            <p>
                                                The role of China in Africa will be discussed, following an overview of
                                                its relationship with each of the above-mentioned states. Thereafter,
                                                the effect that these relationships have on China – African
                                                International Political Economy (IPE) will be mentioned, and finally the
                                                predicted outcome of current relations and recommendations towards a
                                                solution to existing issues in African on China’s part.
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                China as an alternative to traditional Western powers in Africa has had
                                                a great deal of success in its attempt to positively contribute to the
                                                development of infrastructure, peace and security in African states.
                                                This assignment, although briefly mentioning this, will instead focus on
                                                the negative effects following China – African IPE. This serves to
                                                highlight where the Sino – African relationship can improve, as well as
                                                providing suggestions towards this end.
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                This is not to be perceived as a critical analysis on why China should
                                                not become further involved with Africa but rather to help understand
                                                that although these relations have had a generally positive effect on
                                                African development, the negative aspects are just as significant and
                                                therefore need to be studied further to establish the fact that in order
                                                for China to continue a positive relationship with Africa it needs to
                                                consider the negative effects that its actions have on environmental
                                                degradation and social inequality in Africa.

                                            </h3>
                                            <p>
                                                The constantly evolving role of China in Africa has been largely debated
                                                by scholars, analysts and critics in recent years. China has played an
                                                important role in many African states since the 1950s, as a partner
                                                towards independence and an alternative to Western powers that have
                                                historically colonized and exploited Africa for its labour, resources
                                                and location.
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                This is not to say that China has not exploited its African
                                                relationships for the purpose of securing natural resources, but rather
                                                that it has had no prior history of colonization in Africa and is
                                                therefore welcomed more openly by African states and their leaders than
                                                traditional Western powers have been.
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                One of China’s important arguments in developing relationships with
                                                African states is that they wish to consolidate South – South
                                                cooperation between developing states, including those in Africa. The
                                                South – South argument is based on a roughly geographic assumption that
                                                states in the South were often previously colonized or placed at a
                                                disadvantage by the powers of the West. China uses this argument in part
                                                to consolidate partnerships between it and African states in order to
                                                gain acceptance in Africa.

                                                After it has gained the trust of an African state, China opens trade
                                                negotiations in order to provide aid to these states in return for the
                                                wealth of resources that they may possess. This is where much of China’s
                                                existing criticisms are born, as China has demonstrated its ability to
                                                achieve its national interests above all, shrewdly providing African
                                                states with the manufactured goods and resources that they may require
                                                in return for the resources that China requires.

                                                China has taken numerous measures to ensure that it has become Africa’s
                                                largest trading partner, it has provided FDI (Foreign Direct Investment)
                                                into the infrastructural development of African states by building
                                                railway lines, roads, renewable energy structures such as wind turbines,
                                                factories and other structures that have helped Africa to develop beyond
                                                what was previously thought possible.

                                                Trade with China has allowed consumers and manufacturers to gain access
                                                to products and machinery that was previously inaccessible to all but
                                                the wealthy, which has in turned boosted African economic growth through
                                                affordable imports and allowed domestic economic activity to boom by
                                                providing businesses with affordable goods that are needed by consumers.

                                                These are but a few examples of the benefits that China has had on the
                                                African economy and African development. It is unfortunate then to
                                                realise that not every trade agreement between China and Africa has been
                                                as benevolent and beneficial as Africans would have hoped. Numerous
                                                reports exist on the exploitation committed by China in order to gain
                                                much needed African resources, the degree to which China will (often
                                                illegally) go to gain an economic advantage in setting up its trade
                                                agreements with African states.
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                These agreements often include the illicit trading of small arms and
                                                light weapons, military training and support to African states that have
                                                a history of committing human rights violations with these weapons,
                                                China having traded weapons to African states under United Nations
                                                Security Council (UNSC) arms embargoes, as well as selling weapons to
                                                both sides of an armed struggle as seen in the Ethiopia – Eritrea
                                                conflict among others. These weapons were allegedly traded for both the
                                                purpose of gaining political leverage in African states and
                                                subsequently, gaining access to a wealth of African natural resources,
                                                later processed and exported to China to fuel its economic interests.
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                China hungrily acquires and utilizes African resources to power its
                                                domestic economy and sustain its high levels of economic growth. Chinese
                                                analysts realised that the environment in China would not be able to
                                                sustain their levels of growth if they continued to pillage their
                                                domestic resources in an attempt to grow as rapidly as they had been.
                                                This is the primary reason for the development of Sino – African
                                                relations, to fulfil its domestic requirements through trade and the
                                                development of political and economic relations with African states.

                                                These trade agreements often leave the African state at a disadvantage,
                                                even if the ruling elites are satisfied by the outcome of the agreement,
                                                it is usually China that leaves most satisfied. These agreements have
                                                caused environmental concerns in certain states as well as having
                                                increased social inequality in others, depending of the manner of
                                                conduct China adopts, which of course differs between states. In
                                                Mozambique, the Sudan and Zimbabwe are cases of both environmental
                                                degradation and increased social inequality due to Chinese trade
                                                agreements; these will be covered in separate sections, describing each

                            China has become a major actor in the global economy as well as the most prominent emerging
                            power in Africa; however, its relationships with African states have been met with an equal
                            share of both praise and animosity.
